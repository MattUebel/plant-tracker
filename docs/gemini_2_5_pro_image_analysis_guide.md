- **Context Window**: Extensive (supports multiple images with detailed text)
- **Maximum Image Size**: 4.5MB (after processing)
- **Supported Image Formats**: JPEG, PNG, WEBP, HEIC, HEIF

## Image Processing Requirements

Before sending images to the Gemini API, ensure they meet these requirements:

1. **Size Limitation**: Images must be under 4.5MB
2. **Preprocessing**: For optimal performance, consider:
   - Converting images to RGB format (removing alpha channels)
   - Resizing large images while maintaining clarity
   - Using JPEG format with appropriate quality settings (90 is recommended starting point)

## Authentication

To use the Gemini API, you need an API key:

```python
import os
import google.generativeai as genai

# Configure the API with your key
genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

# Create the model instance
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25")
```

## Best Practices for Image Analysis

### 1. Structuring Effective Prompts

For optimal results when analyzing images:

- **Be Specific**: Clearly state what information you want extracted
- **Provide Context**: Tell the model about the purpose of the analysis
- **Request Step-by-Step Analysis**: Ask the model to describe what it sees first
- **Specify Output Format**: Explicitly request structured formats like JSON
- **Place Images First**: For single-image prompts, place the image before text
- **Use Lower Temperatures**: Start with 0.2-0.4 for factual extraction tasks

### 2. Extracting Structured Data

To extract structured data from images:

```python
# Example prompt for structured data extraction
prompt = """
I need you to analyze this image carefully and extract specific information in JSON format.

First, tell me what you see in this image.

Then, extract the following information with these exact field names:
- field1: [description]
- field2: [description]
...

Return ONLY a valid JSON object matching the schema above. Use null for any fields not found in the image.
"""

# Configure generation parameters
generation_config = genai.types.GenerationConfig(
    temperature=0.2,
    response_mime_type="application/json",  # Request JSON response format
)

# Make the API call
response = model.generate_content(
    [prompt, image],
    generation_config=generation_config,
)
```

### 3. Handling JSON Responses

Since the model may return JSON wrapped in markdown code blocks, implement robust parsing:

```python
def extract_json_from_response(response_text):
    """Extract and parse JSON from the model response text."""
    json_str = response_text
    
    # Try to extract JSON from markdown code blocks
    if "```json" in json_str:
        json_str = json_str.split("```json")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
    elif "```" in json_str:
        json_str = json_str.split("```")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
    
    # If still not clear JSON, look for brackets
    if not (json_str.startswith("{") and json_str.endswith("}")):
        if "{" in json_str and "}" in json_str:
            start = json_str.find("{")
            end = json_str.rfind("}") + 1
            json_str = json_str[start:end]
    
    # Clean up common issues
    json_str = json_str.replace('\\"', '"')  # Fix escaped quotes
    json_str = json_str.replace("\\n", " ")  # Fix newlines
    
    return json.loads(json_str)
```

### 4. Implementing Retry Logic

For robust production applications, implement retry logic with exponential backoff:

```python
async def call_api_with_retry(image, prompt, max_retries=3, initial_delay=1.0):
    """Call Gemini API with retry logic."""
    retries = 0
    delay = initial_delay
    
    while retries <= max_retries:
        try:
            response = await asyncio.to_thread(
                model.generate_content, [prompt, image]
            )
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            if retries < max_retries:
                await asyncio.sleep(delay)
                delay *= 2  # Exponential backoff
                retries += 1
            else:
                raise
```

## Optimizing for Structured Data Extraction

Based on the prompting guide, these strategies will help extract structured data from images:

### 1. Break Down Complex Tasks

For detailed image analysis, break down the process:

```
First, describe what you see in this image.
Next, identify the key elements [specific to your domain].
Then, extract the structured data according to this schema...
```

### 2. Hint at Relevant Image Areas

If the model overlooks important details:

```
Examine the top portion of the image for the product name.
Look at the back of the package for nutritional information.
Check the bottom section for planting instructions.
```

### 3. Request Explicit References to the Image

To ensure responses are grounded in the image:

```
Refer specifically to what you see in the image when extracting each data field.
For each field in your JSON response, base it only on information visible in the image.
```

### 4. Adjust Parameters for Different Tasks

- **Factual extraction**: Lower temperature (0.2-0.3), higher top_p (0.8-1.0)
- **Creative descriptions**: Higher temperature (0.7-0.9), varied top_k (20-40)
- **JSON structure adherence**: Explicitly request `response_mime_type="application/json"`

## Sample Implementation for Plant Data Extraction

This example shows how to extract structured data from seed packet images:

```python
async def extract_seed_packet_data(image_path):
    """Extract structured data from a seed packet image."""
    
    # Process image to ensure size requirements
    processed_image = resize_image_for_gemini(image_path)
    img = Image.open(BytesIO(processed_image))
    
    # Craft a detailed prompt
    prompt = """
    I need you to analyze this seed packet image carefully and extract specific information for a garden planting database.

    First, tell me what you see in this image - what type of seeds are shown on this packet?

    Then, extract the following information in a structured JSON format:
    - name: The main plant type (e.g., "Tomato", "Basil", "Carrot")
    - variety: The specific variety name (e.g., "Cherry Sweet", "Genovese", "Nantes")
    - brand: The company/manufacturer of the seed packet
    - germination_rate: The germination rate as a decimal (convert from percentage if needed)
    - maturity: Days to maturity/harvest as an integer number only
    - seed_depth: Recommended planting depth in inches (convert from other units if needed)
    - spacing: Recommended spacing between plants in inches (convert from other units if needed)
    - quantity: Number of seeds in the packet if mentioned
    - notes: Any special growing instructions or other important information

    Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Use null for any fields not found in the image.
    """
    
    # Set generation parameters for structured data
    generation_config = genai.types.GenerationConfig(
        temperature=0.2,
        response_mime_type="application/json",
    )
    
    # Call the API with retry logic
    response = await call_api_with_retry(
        img, prompt, generation_config=generation_config
    )
    
    # Process and validate the response
    structured_data = extract_json_from_response(response.text)
    
    # Validate required fields
    required_fields = ["name", "variety", "maturity", "seed_depth", "spacing"]
    missing_fields = [field for field in required_fields if field not in structured_data]
    
    if missing_fields:
        print(f"Warning: Missing required fields: {', '.join(missing_fields)}")
    
    return structured_data
```

## Troubleshooting

If the model isn't producing accurate structured data:

1. **Check Image Quality**: Ensure the image is clear and all text is legible
2. **Refine Your Prompt**: Be more specific about what information to extract
3. **Two-Stage Approach**: First ask for OCR text extraction, then parse the extracted text
4. **Reduce Temperature**: Lower temperature (0.1-0.2) for more deterministic results
5. **Ask for Reasoning**: Request that the model explain its reasoning to identify where it's failing

## Limitations

Be aware of these limitations when using the Gemini model for image analysis:

1. **Image Quality Dependency**: Results heavily depend on image clarity and lighting
2. **Text Extraction Challenges**: Small or stylized text may be misinterpreted
3. **Inference vs. Facts**: The model may infer information not explicitly stated
4. **Technical Specifications**: Technical details like germination rates may need verification
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing delays between API calls for large batches
